    description: Anthraquinone Blue is a single pigment paint that is a very dark, transparent midnight blue. It has a moderately strong tinting strength, yet is easily controlled when creating mixes. Also known as Indanthrone Blue, this blue is more commonly associated with an indigo. This blue is reminiscent of the night sky when extended with wax medium, maintaining lots of depth and richness as well.  Even though it has a slightly reddish cast it is equally suited to mixing deep purples as well as deep greens. When mixed with white, it tends to grey out to a "navy", and if bluish grey is what you are looking for, try mixing it with any of the umbers and wax medium. It has completely different properties than the Phthalo Blues, Ultramarine or Prussian Blue, making it a necessity to our paint line. Anthraquinone Blue is a featured paint in our Contemporary Set Hot Cakes® Set.

      Opaque, mid-toned grey with a hint towards blue. 
      The color gray is probably the most overlooked color on our palette and yet as artists we are constantly creating it in our mixes. Any time a touch of the compliment color is introduced to the mix we are in essence making a grayed out color. To the degree that we add the compliment will determine how toned down or gray a color will be. We often think of gray as that lifeless color between black and white. 
      If you look up gray in the dictionary here are some words you will come across: dark, dismal, monotonous, dreary, dull. Perhaps these descriptions are more apt to describe the weather, and Enkaustikos agrees! We have revised our Midtone Gray to be anything but lifeless. Our new formula is a combination of all three primaries plus white. Not only does this formula offer each primary it's compliment, it provides you with a very interactive and responsive mix.
      Considered a neutral color; Gray can serve to offer our art a resting place for the eye, a pause, some quiet, a unifier. Yet, our new Midtone Gray is also the purveyor of awakening the color it lies next to. Midtone Gray has a lot of power. It is like a chameleon. It can look yellowish next to purples, reddish next to greens, bluish next to oranges. This optical effect is enhanced because we used the primaries to make this color. Midtone Gray is a convenience color for your palette. It is opaque and because our eyes can detect the smallest shifts in colors, you will see it has a reddish violet undertone with a bluish green mass tone. We hope you will enjoy painting with Midtone Gray and look forward to seeing the great results you accomplish with it.

    description: You might ask why we would mill a Transparent Red Earth when we have other colors that are so similar, such as Burnt Sienna, Pompeii Red, even Mars Venetian and Mars Terracotta. The answer is this. We know that at first glance, pigments may appear similar, but to an artist, the difference comes in the mixes. Transparent Red Earth has deep, rich, red undertone, which make it a natural for extending with either wax medium or XD wax medium to create thin veils of color. Certain pigments will lose their strength when extended, but Transparent Red Earth will hold its own due to the strong tinting power. In fact, the true beauty of this color is found when extended with wax medium alone, where the cinnamon red can be most appreciated. Transparent Red Earth is featured in our Hot Cakes® Glazing Set.
