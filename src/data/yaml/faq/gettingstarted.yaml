 - question: What Supplies Do I Need To Start Painting?
   answer: |
      You can start with the necessities and then add more tools or paints as you get more comfortable with the medium.  We recommend you watch our youtube video where Kathryn walks you through the basic supplies and check out our safety guidelines webpage to help get you acquainted with studio recommendations.
      <br/><br/>
       A checklist for beginners:<br/>
       A hot palette. Pancake griddles are easily affordable at department stores and work well for encaustic use.<br/>
       Wax paints. Start with the basic color palette, primary colors, to get a handle on color mixing techniques and then add additional colors as you go.<br/>
       Wax Medium. This is used for basecoats, topcoats, extending colors, and glazing.<br/>
       Slick Wax. This is our non-solvent cleaner used for cleaning your palette and brushes.<br/>
       A heat gun or torch for fusing.<br/>
       Hog bristle brushes.<br/>
       Paper towels.<br/>
       Substrates that are compatible with encaustic.<br/>
       Optional: A variety of tools such as scrapers, pottery loops, or picks are also nice to have on hand if you would like to try scraping or incising effects.  These tools are easy to find at your local art supply store or you may even have them in your studio already.

 - question: What Substrates Do i Use for Wax Painting?
   answer: We typically recommend you use substrates that are absorbent and rigid such as wood panels. However, many of today’s artists are working on a variety of papers as well. Since artists are experimenting all the time, we’ve actually discovered that many artists are even using lightweight watercolor and printmaking papers. Artists that work in thin layers or who do encaustic monoprints are working on very thin, almost transparent (yet strong) Japanese rice papers. The key is that your substrates need to be absorbent. This even includes cotton canvas mounted to a board, unglazed ceramic, and lowfired bisqueware. There are plenty of options available to artists when it comes to choosing a substrate. A traditional gesso made from rabbit skin glue and precipitated chalk  will provide a nice absorbent surface to work on while acrylic based gesso is not compatible with the encaustic process.  Wax paint simply will not bond to the acrylic polymer and the wax paint will flake off the substrate.  The best way to determine whether a substrate is suitable for encaustic is by doing "The Freezer Test".

 - question: Are There Any Health Or Safety Guidelines?
   answer: As with all art mediums, health and safety concerns must always be addressed. Encaustic painting is solventfree, eliminating the need for turpentine, mineral spirits, or oily rags in the studio. An encaustic studio should be set up just like an oil or acrylic painting studio with good ventilation and circulation of fresh air. An ideal encaustic studio should have an open window to allow the entry of fresh air and an exhaust fan near or above your hot palette to remove fumes. Of course common sense caution should be exercised when working with any of the heated equipment like the hot palette or heat gun. Our paints are artist quality therefore we do not recommend our paints for children under the age of 12 because our paints are made with artist grade pigments. A good working temperature for the wax paint is between 150175 degrees Fahrenheit.  This working temperature is extremely important when working with encaustic paints as it will allow you to avoid creating fumes and help  maintain the paint's integrity. Please refer to our Safety Guidelines listed on the website and read the Material Safety Data Sheets available for our products.

 - question: What Is Fusing?
   answer: Although wax paint is applied in layers, paintings require intermittent fusing to merge the layers together.  That is, fusing as you work simply means to apply heat to allow each layer to soften enough in order to merge with the previous or subsequent layers.  You need to form one single paint film and fusing will do that for you. Fusing can be done with heat guns, torches, embossing guns, heat lamps. Heat guns are ideal for people just starting out. They can be easily found at your local department store and typically sell for $25 to $30. It is a low cost investment and you will be using this tool frequently as you paint.  Take note, that hair dryers are not suitable for fusing as they simply do not get hot enough to fuse the paint layers properly.  We recommend you check out our youtube video that features the fusing process if you would like to see how it is performed.

 - question: What Is Wax Medium?
   answer: 'Enkaustikos Wax Medium is made from United States Pharmaceutical Grade Beeswax and Damar Resin. Wax Medium is used for a variety of purposes when it comes to encaustic painting. It can be used as a topcoat, a base coat, or even used to create a textured surface. You can also add it to your wax paints to increase the transparency of colors for glazing techniques or use it to mix in your own pigments for custom colors. Wax Medium can even be used for collage techniques. We manufacturer three different types of Wax Medium: Original, Natural Yellow, and XD which contains extra damar to give it a stickier tack and thicker consistency. Check out our YouTube channel to see demonstrations on glazing, priming, and even collage.'

 - question: What Is Slick Wax?
   answer: Slick Wax is our unique synthetic cleaning formula that is designed to clean your encaustic brushes, tools, and palette.  Slick Wax eliminates the need for any type of solvent in your studio.  Slick Wax will remove wax paint colors from your brushes in between color changes and allow you to keep your hot palette clean between color mixing techniques.  Simply have a melted tin of Slick Wax on your palette and dip your brushes into it to get rid of excess paint.  After dipping your brush in the Slick Wax, wipe off the excess with a paper towel and get right back to painting.  By using Slick Wax, you can avoid color contamination and make nice, clean color mixes! An alternative to Slick Wax is Soy Wax.

 - question: What Types Of Brushes Can I Use In Encaustic?
   answer: We recommend you use shorthandled, natural bristle brushes. Avoid synthetic brushes because they may burn while working with heat. Hoghaired brushes like slotted brushes or goathaired brushes like Hake brushes are great for encaustic.  Slick Wax is a great product to use to clean your brushes between color changes or uses.

 - question: Does Enkaustikos Sell Palettes For Encaustic Use?
   answer: At the current time, Enkaustikos does not sell hot palettes. We recommend that artists purchase an affordable electric cooking griddle from a department store. Cooking griddles work nicely in encaustic and are a small investment for those just starting off. Retail stores sell cooking griddles for as little as $20 to $30USD. Take a look at our youtube videos to see different ways to use a pancake griddle. https://www.youtube.com/user/Enkaustikos

 - question: Can Encaustic Be Used For Realism? 
   answer: This is one of the most common questions we receive from customers just learning about the encaustic medium and the answer isyes!! Encaustic painting does not limit you when it comes to  the subject matter. Look at the famous, Faiyum Mummy portraits of  Egypt.  We suggest you take a look at our Featured Artist section  as well to see what other artists are doing with this medium.  There are a lot of different ways to express yourself with encaustic.
