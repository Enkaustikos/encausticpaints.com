  - question: How Do I Clean My Brushes And Store My Paint Between Use?
    answer: When you're done with your painting session, just turn off the heated palette, leave the wax in your brushes, and cover your tins when the paint cools.  It's that simple.  The tins will keep your paints safe and dust-free during storage while the wax paint on your brushes will keep the bristles intact.  The next time you want to paint, all you have to do is re-heat the palette to reactivate the wax.  You must remember that the brushes you decide to use must be dedicated solely to encaustic.  Once they are used in the wax paint, you will never completely get the wax out of the bristles so just have brushes set aside for your encaustic paintings only.  We do recommend  using Slick Wax  to clean the excess paint off your brushes between color changes so that you do not need one brush per color.  The use of Slick Wax will help you to prevent color contamination.  To be extra clean, you can also use Slick Wax on your palette to clean it off when you're done color mixing or painting.
